In progress:

 * Event Service -- for serializing Fedora Events to a broker technology, such as Kafka or AMQP
 * Core implementation -- for creating, deleting, updating and fetching resources, based on RDF-Patch and a kafka event bus
 * HTTP layer -- this will use dropwizard.io
 * Cloud-based datastream resolver based on jclouds
